This is the source code for ZDoom 1.17c released on 5 May 1999.

It is based on the Linux DOOM sources that were prepared by B. Krenheimer
and generously released by John Carmack shortly before Christmas, 1997. If
you wish to obtain the original Linux source distribution, you can find it
at ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/source/doomsrc.zip. Portions of code were also
taken from various other source ports, the majority of them coming from
the BOOM Phase I source released on 27 May 1998 (credit Team TNT and Chi
Hoang). There's even stuff from Hexen (though not much) in there. Many
changes are, of course, my own, and I've tried to flag them as such with
[RH] comments blocks (although I missed a few before I started the
commenting convention).

The file rh-log.txt in the code directory lists my adventures with the
source code on a mostly day-by-day basis. This file only goes back to the
time when I released 1.11, because that's when I created this file. Most of
the other text files in the code directory are from the original Linux
source code and do not accurately reflect the state of many of the files
used now.

If you do use these sources, you should also be familiar with doomlic.txt.
This is the license agreement for the Doom sources. The file COPYING
applies to the patch program and NOT the Doom source code. I'd also
appreciate a short e-mail so that I know if anyone's actually using
this. :-)

To compile this source code, you also need to download several other
packages if you don't already have them. These are:

  MIDAS Digital Audio System
    http://www.s2.org/MIDAS/

    Be sure to link with the static library and not the DLL version of
    MIDAS! I use a hack from NTDOOM that crashes with the DLL but not the
    static library.

  Prometheus Truecolor Library (PTC) 0.72
    http://www.gaffer.org/ptc

    IMPORTANT NOTE! PTC 0.72 is no longer available at gaffer.org. If you
    need it, e-mail me, and I can send you the source for it.

    Once you get the source, you'll need to build at least the release
    build of PTC. The batch files provided with PTC to do this will generate
    the library somewhere in ../library. In my case, this ends up being
    d:/games/doom/ptc/library/win32/vc5.x.

  NASM (for the assembly files)
    http://www.cryogen.com/Nasm

    If you don't want to use NASM, you can #define NOASM while compiling
    ZDoom, and it will use C code instead.

The included project file (doom.dsp) is for Visual C++ 5.0 and makes a few
assumptions about the development environment:

    MIDAS is installed at the same location in the directory hierarchy as
    the ZDoom source code. In my case, I have the source in
    d:/games/doom/code, so MIDAS is in d:/games/doom/midas. I_music.c and
    I_sound.c also look for MIDAS include files in the "../midas"
    directory.

    NASM is installed in d:/nasm.

    PTC is installed in d:/games/doom/ptc.

If you want to put things in different places, you'll need to adjust the
project file's settings accordingly.

This code should also compile with Watcom C 10.6 (and presumably newer
versions as well). If you use Watcom, please tell me if the following NASM
line generates object files for tmap.nas and misc.nas that are usable with
the Watcom linker:

    nasm -o file.obj -f obj -d M_TARGET_WATCOM file.nas

(The line I use is "nasm -o file.obj -f win32 file.nas" which works with
Microsoft's linker, but not Watcom's.)

If you want to recompile the DOS code, you need DJGPP and Allegro. Allegro
is only needed because MIDAS uses its interrupt wrappers. I don't use it
for anything myself. The makefile.dj file can be used with make to
generate either a release or debug build. (Create the appropriate
subdirectories under code/djgpp first.)
